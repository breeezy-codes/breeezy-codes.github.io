    <p class="About Me"> I kicked off my coding adventure by securing a position as a social media manager at a budding startup. Collaborating closely with the Lead Graphic Designer, <strong>Jeffrey McQurik</strong>, I absorbed fundamental graphic design skills. This journey led me into the realm of After Effects, an Adobe tool that breathes life into static images. As I refined my animation and graphic design expertise, I felt the pull to embark on my own path. Post our departure from the startup, Jeff and I combined forces to birth PRIZMOZI, a stellar Graphic Design Agency. Our repertoire spanned a wide spectrum of graphical designs, including building banners, vehicle wraps, logos, social media content, animations, and website designs. Initially, we constructed websites using Wix, a no-code platform simplifying the web development process. However, we soon encountered limitations in design and embedding capabilities. This realization spurred me to delve into coding. Starting with HTML and CSS, I laid the groundwork. Now, armed with these crucial foundations, I've set sail on a project that marks the beginning of my odyssey into a full-stack engineering career.
