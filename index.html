    <p class="About-Me Center"> I kicked off my coding adventure by securing a position as a social media manager at a budding startup. Collaborating closely with the Lead Graphic Designer, <strong>Jeffrey McQurik</strong>, I absorbed fundamental graphic design skills. This journey led me into the realm of <a class="hyperlink" href= "https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects/campaign/pricing.html?gclid=Cj0KCQjwmvSoBhDOARIsAK6aV7iihW1BhpOWiX063S6kSPdP5MuHf3XQEwM4O1ke6PQPkrE0D7Wn-2saArokEALw_wcB&sdid=KKQOW&kw=semgeneric&mv=search&ef_id=Cj0KCQjwmvSoBhDOARIsAK6aV7iihW1BhpOWiX063S6kSPdP5MuHf3XQEwM4O1ke6PQPkrE0D7Wn-2saArokEALw_wcB:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!3085!3!614772532986!e!!g!!adobe%20after%20effects!1712851902!78450202215&mv=search">After Effects</a>, an Adobe tool that breathes life into static images. As I refined my animation and graphic design expertise, I felt the pull to embark on my own path. Post our departure from the startup, Jeff and I combined forces to birth <a class="hyperlink" href="http://www.prizmozi.com">PRIZMOZI</a>, a stellar Graphic Design Agency. Our repertoire spanned a wide spectrum of graphical designs, including building banners, vehicle wraps, logos, social media content, animations, and website designs. Initially, we constructed websites using Wix, a no-code platform simplifying the web development process. However, we soon encountered limitations in design and embedding capabilities. This realization spurred me to delve into coding. Starting with HTML and CSS, I laid the groundwork. Now, armed with these crucial foundations, I've set sail on a project that marks the beginning of my odyssey into a full-stack engineering career.
